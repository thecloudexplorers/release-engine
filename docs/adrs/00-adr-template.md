## ADR Template Usage Instructions

### When to Create an ADR
Create an ADR for any architectural decision that:
- Has long-term impact on the Release Engine
- Affects multiple components or teams
- Involves significant trade-offs
- Changes existing patterns or approaches
- Establishes new standards or guidelines

### How to Use This Template
1. **Copy this template** to a new file: `XX-short-title.md`
2. **Fill in all sections** - don't skip sections, use "N/A" if not applicable
3. **Be specific and concrete** - avoid vague statements
4. **Include implementation details** - help future maintainers understand the decision
5. **Review with stakeholders** before marking as "Accepted"
6. **Update status** as the decision evolves

### ADR Lifecycle
1. **Proposed**: Initial draft, under review
2. **Accepted**: Decision approved and being implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Decision is outdated but still in use
4. **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision (reference the new ADR)

### Tips for Good ADRs
- **Write for your future self** - you'll need to understand this decision months/years later
- **Document the context** - explain why the decision was needed
- **Show your work** - explain how you evaluated options
- **Be honest about trade-offs** - acknowledge the downsides
- **Keep it concise** but comprehensive
- **Use examples** where helpful
